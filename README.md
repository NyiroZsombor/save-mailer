## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up an App Password

To use this tool, you will need an **app-specific password**. 
For G-mail, Manage your account (top right in Google apps) > Security (on the left) > search for app passwords (on top) > create new app-password. 
Give it any name but be careful, the auto-generated 16-character **app-password is only shown once**.

### 2. Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed then install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the program

Run `main.py` from your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
### 4. Configuration

On the first startup will be prompted to enter your **E-mail address** and **app password** which will be encrypted and stored locally.

### 5. Create a template

Before using the app you have to create a template. Do this with the `new` command then follow the steps. 
It is recomended to create a template for each but you don't have to for each save.

You can now send and load the save files. You will have to set up the program on each device.
